# ePubViewer
A simple ePub viewer

To run this development version, download electron and run the command below, replacing `/path/to/electron/` with the path to the electron binary file.

    /path/to/electron /path/to/github/repository/ePubViewer/app/ePubViewer/

You can also open the ePubViewer/app/ePubViewer/reader/index.html
 file in Google Chrome or Firefox , but put an epub in the same folder(ePubViewer/app/ePubViewer/reader/) and add ?url=epubname.epub to the url.
