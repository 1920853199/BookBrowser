## Note: This is just [geek1011/ePubViewer](http://github.com/geek1011/ePubViewer), but with a change. The file chooser button is set to `display:none`, this message has been added, and the build script is removed. To update this, just put the new `index.html`, `reader.js`, and `reader.css` in this folder, then fix up `index.html`.
